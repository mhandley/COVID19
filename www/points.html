<P>
This page presents historical SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection
information.  I try to present it in a way that helps inform about how
the virus is progressing throughout the main outbreaks worldwide in a
way that allows countries to be compared and perhaps lessons learned.
The underlying infection and containment processes are complicated,
and conclusions you or I may draw from these graphs are not true
predictions.  For that, you'd need much more data about what is being
done in each country, and about how the data is collected. Comments
are my interpretation only.  Nevertheless, I hope you find it useful.

<LI>Certain increase rates: 35%, 22%, 13.5% and 8% really stand out in
  the data, as each country has settled on these rates for a while at
  different phases of the epidemic. I don't have any good
  justification for why these specific increase rates exist as strong
  features of the data, but they do appear to be quite prominent at
  the relative phases of the epidemic.  Likely they are related to
  various levels of social distancing performed by these countries.

<LI>On this graph I show the confirmed cases for Western European
countries, with the curves aligned at the point when each had just
transitioned from 35% daily increases to 22% daily increases.  This
view highlights the differences between countries, but is less useful
than <a href="#covid-eu-norm">the next graph</a> for understanding
similarities, so I will reserve dicussion of the individual curves for
that graph.

</UL>

<LI> In contrast to graph 1, which highlights any divergence, <B>on this
graph I'm showing these countries aligned with the 8% curve</B> as all
of them now appear to have left both the 22% and 13.5% curves.  I'm also showing a shorter time interval.

<LI>Italy followed the 8% curve for about five days before
peaking. Italy has now dropped off of exponential increases and the
daily increase count appears to have peaked, though it has not declined greatly..

<LI> For the last week France and Germany both appear to have been
tracking close to the 8% daily increase curve that Italy followed.
Once increases get this small, it is hard to distinguish constant
increases from exponential increases on this graph.
In the case of Germany, the daily increase in cases has been
relatively constant, though it is not yet clear whether this represents
a peak.

<LI> The Netherlands roughly followed the 8% curve for five days, but
the last two days show lower increases. It is starting to look like
cases in the Netherlands may have peaked 7 days ago.

<LI>Switzerland has a relatively small population, and so the number
    of cases per million inhabitants is much higher.  Switzerland is
    shown with no time offset to Italy.  
    
  <LI> See the <a href="#deaths-eu-norm">this death rates graph</a>
    for why I am not confident in this placement for Switzerland. From
    that graph Switzerland looks to be as much as 10 days behind
    Italy.

  <LI> For 15 days now, Switzerland has seen roughly constant daily
  increases, which suggests Switzerland may be peaking.  The
  alternative explaination - that testing capacity is saturated -
  seems unlikely, as Switzerland is reporting only 15% of test results
  are positive.  I think the Swiss cases data is likely reasonably
  good.
    
  <LI>Spain stayed at 35% daily increases for much longer than any
    other large European country, which caused it to close on Italy,
    then followed the 22% curve for a week. Spain only roughly aligned
    with the 13.5% curve, although it joined this curve at roughly the
    point where Italy departed it.  For the last ten days the number
    of new cases in Spain has been roughly constant, with the last two
    days showing a decrease.  We need to wait a few more days before
    we have confidence that Spain has peaked, but it beginning to look
    like it has.

<LI>On this graph I show the countries that I believe have likely
peaked, and I have aligned the day they peaked at day 0.

<LI>It doesn't really make sense to show Chinese cases per million
inhabitants, when 82% of the cases were in Hubei province.  I have
therefore used the Hubei population as the China population when
calculating cases per million inhabitants.  Really all I care about on
this graph is the shape of the curve.

<LI>It is notable that China and Korea rose faster to their peaks and
declined faster from their peaks than western countries.

<LI>Finland was previously on this graph, but no longer looks to have peaked.</UL>

<LI>Some countries appear to be peaking, in that the number of new

doesn't start going back down quickly.  You can get a broad peak like
this:

<UL>

<LI>when you have multiple outbreaks in a country that are not
aligned in time: some are still growing while others are declining.

<LI>isolation methods have brought
the number of people each infected person passes COVID19 on to down to
almost exactly one, but this is unlikely.

<LI>if you're only testing severe cases and testing is
saturated, so the numbers only report the testing capacity.

</UL>

<LI>We can look at death rates data to try and rule out the third option.  Death rate data lags case data by 1-2 weeks, but we can see the start of a levelling in deaths in Switzerland and Luxembourg.  There have not been enough deaths in Iceland, Bulgaria or Slovakia to case any light on the issue, either way.</UL>

Generally the UK has been following France around a week behind.

<LI>The very rapid increase rate in the US appears to have tailed off,
but I suspect it has some way to go before peaking.  As the epidemic
is at different stages in different states, the US curve is less
likely to show a sharp peak when it does occur.

<LI>The graph shows cumulative number of <B>deaths per million
      inhabitants</B>, plotted on a log scale, against time.  The
      country curves are shown offset by the amounts shown.</LI>
    <LI> As different countries have different testing policies, many
      people have suggested that we should look at deaths instead.
      There are several downsides to using deaths as a metric.  First,
      if the purpose of these graphs is to provide warning of what is
      to come, or to verify whether measure are working, deaths is not
      very useful.  Death rate is too low to provide a warning signal
      in advance of there being a problem, and it is not a good early
      indicator of whether measures are working because it lags case
      data by between one and two weeks.  It can, however, provide
      some insight into what fraction of infections are being detected
      in different countries.  Generally, if a country is further
      behind in this graph than in the equivalent cases graph, then
      the country is probably catching a larger fraction of cases.
      This is particularly pronounced in the case of Germany.
    <LI>
      Death data is also problematic because deaths per day does not
      go down quickly when cases go down.  This is particularly clear
      in the Korean data, where the death rate has remained nearly
      constant for three weeks after new infections peaked.
    <LI>
      Finally, when a healthcare system gets overwhelmed, death rate
      goes up from something like 0.9% (Korea) to something like 3-4%
      (Hubei, parts of Lombardy).
    <LI>
      Generally when cases are increasing exponentially, most
      countries' death rate curves shadow the cases curve, with a lag
      of between 6 (France, UK) and 12 days (Germany).  Spain, France,
      Netherlands and the UK look very similar to how they looked using
      case data around 6 days ago.  Germany is about ten days further
      back on this graph.  The difference in
      per-capita testing rates does not seem to explain this
      difference.

<LI>In the last few dats, the UK and France have seen more deaths than
Italy did at a similar point in the epidemic, whereas Switzerland has
seem fewer deaths.

  <LI>I have aligned the 35% daily increase rate parts of the four
    graphs, so the points at which they diverge can be seen.  As a
    result the graph shows Lombardy as being 5.5 days ahead of Italy,
    but a more realistic value based on today's data points is seven
    days ahead.

  <LI>Lombardy and Italy now appear to have peaked, see Graph 3,
  though the daily increase in cases is not declining rapidly.

  <LI>Switzerland tracked along the 35% curve about six days further
    than Italy did, so comparing with Italy as a whole did not seem to
    be the right baseline.  During this time Lombardy results provided
    a better reference curve.  However in the last week Switzerland
    has dropped off of the Lombardy curve and no longer is seeing
    exponential growth.
    
  <LI>Austria also followed the Lombardy curve pretty faithfully about
  ten days behind.  It now looks like Austria peaked eight days ago,
  and, unlike Lombardy, Austria has seen a pronounced decrease in new
  cases each day since.

      <LI>Data for most Nordic countries showed large waves of
      imported cases, with increase rates above 35%, followed by a
      slump as the imports cease. Sometimes this is followed six or so
	days later by an echo of the original surge.
	
      <LI>Iceland suffered a large number of imported cases relative
      to its very small population.  After that burst stopped, Iceland
      followed roughly the same curve as Italy, two days ahead.
      Twelve days ago Iceland's increase rate increased for five days,
      but it has now levelled off at a similar rate to Italy. It is
      possible that this increase was due to increased testing rather
      than a burst in new cases.  Iceland is now showing signs that it is peaking.
      
      <LI>Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland all managed to stop the
      majority of imported cases from spreading too far, but
      afterwards they all restarted exponential growth from a smaller
      base of active cases, hence the relatively shallow gradients of
      their curves.  All these countries are showing signs that they
      make peak shortly.

<LI>Generally, trends are easier to see on a cumulative plot, as
changes are inherently more noisy.  However, this view is better
to see whether a country has peaked or not.

<LI>Daily increases in absolute numbers have been nearly constant for
several days in Luxembourg and Iceland.  This is likely to an indication
that the infection rate in these countries is peaking, though we won't
be sure until it has been going down again for more than a week.
Certainly, exponential growth is no longer occurring in these
countries.

<LI>Two days ago, Finland looked like it had peaked.  Unfortunately
the last two days showed this to be incorrect, and Finland has
experienced a rush of new cases.  Nevertheless, as the curve had been
level for so long, it seems unlikely that Finland will return to
exponential growth, but time will tell.

<LI>Norway was growing exponentially until 26th March, then decreased
for six days. The last three days have shown modest increases again;
these waves against a relatively static background level seems to be a
common feature in the Nordic region.

<LI>Denmark and Sweden have very similar exponential increase rate
profiles for the last two weeks. Neither country is yet showing clear signs of peaking.

<LI>In mid March, Estonia looked like it had peaked, but this
behaviour has happened in other countries such as Denmark, where a
large number of case are imported.  The imported cases are mostly
tracked down, leading to a dip, then growth again as transmission that
was missed grows.  The peak seven days ago may be an echo of the
original imported peak - this happened in Denmark and Sweden too,
though their echoes were less pronounced.  The last three data points
seem to indicate another wave of cases is in progress; whether this
wave is higher than the previous one is not yet clear.</UL>

      <LI>In Belgium, the initial early ramp-up appears to be mostly

      increase curve to that followed by Italy
      <LI>Ireland and Portugal continue to follow the Italian curve closely, about 12 days behind.
      <LI>Luxembourg has a very small population, so the curve is

      well above the point Lombardy reached at this stage of the
      infection, but the last two datapoints hint at lower increases
      around 22% in the future.  See the next graph for why I am not

<LI>Luxembourg is such an outlier in the previous graph that this
leads me to doubt that the confirmed case data is comparable with
other countries.  The number of deaths in Luxembourg is very small -
only eight - but it's just enough that we can get a very rough
cross-calibration of case data vs death data.  It seems likely that
testing in Luxembourg is much more effective than in France or Italy,
and so is identifying many more people whose symptoms would be too
mild to merit testing in France or Germany.  It is clear that there
are a large number of cases in Luxembourg, but not so many more per
million inhabitants as the previous graph shows.  It looks like deaths
lag case data by about ten days more in Luxembourg than in France.
The German data shows a similar additional lag.

  A Holt-Winters moving average filter with constants &alpha;=0.5 and
  &beta;=0.5 has been applied to smooth the curves as differences are
  very noisy.  This is a moderate amount of smoothing and it imposes a
  about a days lag, but it does extract trends fairly well.  The
  curves are not offset, today is Day 0 for all curves.</LI>
<LI>Generally, trends are easier to see on a cumulative plot, as
    changes are inherently more noisy.  However, this view is better
    to see whether a country has peaked or not.

<LI>I thought Slovakia had peaked a few days ago, but it appears I was
wrong.  Nevertheless, growth there is almost constant, and certainly
no longer exponential.

<LI>Increase are also roughly level in Bulgaria, which is likely peaking now too.

<LI>Greece appears to be close to peaking - the daily increase has
  been nearly constant for a number of days, and it no longer shows
  signs of significant exponential growth.

<LI> The last three days data for Slovenia and the Czech Republic have
show decreases, but this is still too short a duration to have any
confidence they have peaked.

<LI>Hungary, Romania and Poland are still growing exponentially with a
relatively low daily increase rate, though today's data point for Serbia is down.

<LI>Serbia dipped the last two days after a steady exponential
increases the last two weeks.  I suspect it has not yet peaked (it
would be rather sudden if it has), but we will only know in a few more days.</UL>

     <LI> The early part of the China curve is shown for
     comparison. I'm not sure how accurate the numbers are in the
     early stage because they didn't initially know what to look for,
     and the way of measuring changed part way through this period.
     The initial increase rate is fairly consistent with the 35% daily growth seen in
     Europe.

<LI>Other than China, South Korea is the only country to have had a
     high sustained increase rate, and then bring the virus under
     control.

<LI>The USA tracked very closely along the 35% growth
     line, and did so for much longer than any other
     country. Testing in the US was initially very limited, but
     recently it seems testing has been catching up somewhat. In the
     last five days the US has shown the first signs of dropping off of
     the 35% daily increase curve.

<LI>Cases in the US are concentrated in a few states, in a
     similar way to how cases in Italy are concentrated in
     Lombardy.

<LI>Iran tracked a little above a 35% increase rate until four weeks
  ago.  Since then, Iran had experienced ten days of consistent 11.5%
  exponential growth, with the following ten days showing further
  decline.  For many days the daily increase in cases was roughly
  constant at around 1100-1200 new cases per day, but it has now
  started to increase exponentially again, now at around 8% per day.
  It is possible the constant phase was due to limitations in testing.

<LI>Japan is has been an enigma for a long time, with an extremely
  consistent 8.5% per day daily growth rate for many weeks, until two
  weeks when it has declined further, before rebounding significantly
  in the last few days.  It seems more likely that early measures
  taken there were effective to some degree at reducing the increase
  rate, but are not sufficient to avoid exponential growth altogether.
  There is some discussion that the historic figures for Japan may not
  have been accurate, but I won't speculate on this other than to note
  that the Japanese curve has always been an unusual outlier.</UL>

<LI>In this view, the US moves a few days further behind Italy.  This
  is probably deceptive, and it might be better to show data for
  New York State, for example, on this graph.

<LI>I've added a curve for Singapore, which contained the initial
  imported cases very well through contact tracing.  However the graph
  shows a worrying slow but steady super-exponential growth until
  about a week ago.  This growth was due in part to contact tracing
  losing its effectiveness, and recently Singapore announced more
  isolation measures as the number of untraced cases was rising.

<LI>I have added a curve for Australia, which appears to be in the
early stages of peaking.  If this continues, the curve will continue
to curve downwards to eventually parallel the Korean curve.

<LI>Most US states are a long way behind European countries, but

    York and perhaps New Jersey are ahead. I have only plotted the 11
    states with most confirmed cases.

<LI>European countries moved from a 35% daily increase curve to a 22%
    daily increase curve, and then to a 13.5% curve as isolation
    measures started to work. In the last few days almost all the
    states I'm tracking have transitioned to the 13.5% curve so I have
    aligned them with the curve that Italy and France followed.

<LI>New York was growing at close to the 35% daily increase rate seen
    in Europe, but then had very large increases over a week.  This
    usually happens when cases have been spreading undetected and
    suddenly testing starts catching up. Since then the increase rate
    has declined significantly and in the last few days, cases in NY
    have been growing exponentially at the much lower rate of around
    13.5% per day.  I have placed New York so as to align it with the
    13.5% curve, though it is much further along that curve than
    either Italy or Lombardy reached.  As Italy seems to have peaked
    and New York has more cases per head of population than Italy, it
    makes no sense saying where New York is on Italy's track: New York
    is forming its own track.

<LI>New Jersey, Louisiana, Massachussetts and Michigan have tracked
further up the 13.5% curve than Italy did.  None of these states are

<LI>Confirmed cases in the US have been growing very fast recently.
The US testing procedures were very slow to get started, but are
reported to have scaled up quickly.  How much of the rapid increase in
case data is due to this scale-up?  This graph shows the US death
rate, with Italy and France for comparison.  When looking at confirmed
cases, the US is roughly 15 days behind Italy, whereas when looking at
death rates, the US is roughly 19 days behind Italy.  This probably
indicates that a small part of the recent increases is indeed due to
improved testing, but the difference is nowhere near as large as
Germany or Luxembourg, so the underlying infection rate must also be
high.  If this gap widens in the future, then this would be evidence
  that testing is getting ahead of the epidemic.
  <LI> To put this in perspective if Italy is identifying just the ~10% of infections that need ICU care, the US is probably identifying very roughly ~30% of infections. (1.35 ^ 4 ~= 3)

<LI>Since then, Taiwan has peaked, Thailand looks like it may peak soon, and the increase rates for Vietnam and Cambodia have dropped off greatly.</UL>

  <LI>Most warm countries do not have enough cases to establish a clear
  increase rate trend.  The graph shows number of confirmed case for
  some typical "cool" countries and some "warm" ones.  

<LI>India, Indonesia and Egypt are all warm countries and have all been experiencing
    roughly 14% daily growth.

<LI>Australia used to be on the 14% curve, but three weeks ago it
  switched to the 22% curve.  The mean daytime
  temperature in Sydney for the five days before March 3rd (17 days
  ago) was 28.6C, whereas for the five days after March 3rd it was
  23.8C.  More analysis is needed to know if this is significant.
  There is no equivalent warming associated with the most recent
  reduction in daily growth, so this is likely to be related to social
  distancing measures. Australia now looks like it <a href="#rates-peaked">may have peaked</a>.

<LI>Malaysia had been tracking close to 14%, but the last week seems
to have transitioned to around 5-6% grouwth.

<LI>Brazil was tracking roughly along the 35% line for a while, which
seems to run counter to warm weather inhibiting the spread of the
virus, but recently it has moved to lower growth.  I have now aligned
Brazil with the 14% curve experience by other warm countries, though
the fit is imperfect.  Brazil actually has both tropical and
equatorial climate zones, so it clear how this should manifest in
COVID-19 progression.

<LI> Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait have very low recent increase levels. This
  may indicate that most cases were imports, and that local spread has
  been effectively contained.

<LI>Although Singapore has a warm climate, I have omitted it from this
  graph, because strong contact tracing there dwarfs any
  climate-dependent effect we might observe.

<LI> In general, it does appear that COVID19 may spread more slowly in
  warm climates, but the evidence is inconclusive, and it appears to
  require relatively hot temperatures to have much effect.

<LI>The graph shows <b>number of confirmed cases</b>, plotted on a
linear scale, against time.  The country curves are shown offset
by the amounts shown.</LI>

 <LI>In the other graphs I use a log scale on the y-axis because
    exponential growth gives a straight line on a log-linear graph,
    and this makes changes in the growth rates visible and allows
    exponential growth rates to be compared. However, many readers
    have told me they don't like log-linear graphs, so this one is for
    them.  It has to be truncated, or you cannot see any information.
    It doesn't really show anything additional over the log graphs,
    except it looks scarier and shows how much worse things are set to
    get if effective measures are not taken.

<LI>I have shown the China curve until the daily increase rate drops
    below 0.1%.  The glitch in the center of this curve is a change in
    measurement methodology.

<LI>Italy closely followed the Chinese curve during the exponential period, but took longer to bring the epidemic under control. Italy is no longer rising exponentially, but new cases are not yet declining much either.

<LI>One thing this view shows well is how much of an outlier the US
   is - the faster increase rate of the US
   curve is self-evident. 
   
<LI>This view also makes clearer the recent restart of exponential
  growth in Iran, and its subsequent reduction.  It is unclear to me
  whether exponential growth actually had previously stopped in Iran,
  or whether the increase rate was simply limited by their testing
  capacity.  If it was the latter, then something about their process
  for confirming cases has changed.

<LI>I have added Austria to this graph, as it is the western country
that most clearly appears to have peaked.  If this is the case, it
should trend in a similar way to South Korea, although it is not clear
if the decline in new cases will be as quick in Austria as it was in
South Korea.</UL>

<h3>Thoughts</h3>
<P>
    While you're sitting pondering your mortality, think how astounding it is that one single viral particle from a bat can replicate so far, so fast, and cause so much trouble!  Biology is truly amazing!

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<P><B>Q: Where does the data come from?</B>
<P>Where possible, the data comes from the relevant national
authorities, as they tend to be more up to date.  In some cases I'm
using
the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports">WHO
daily briefing</a>, but they lag the national authorities somewhat.

<P><B>Q: Can I have your data?</B>
  <P>My data is <a href="https://github.com/mhandley/COVID19/">on github</a>.
  <P>A more complete dataset is the <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series">Johns Hopkins</a> one. It tends to lag the national data sources and the WHO, but it is complete and machine readable.

  <P><B>Q: Can I use your graphs?</B>
  <P>
    Yes, they're under a CC0 "No rights reserved" license.  You can
    use them for any purpose.  I'd prefer you link back here though,
    as the explanations add important context.

  <P><B>Q: Different countries are testing at different rates.  How can you compare the data?</B>
    <P>So long as the fraction of actual cases being detected does
    not change, this does not affect any inference we can make about
    the growth rate.  35% growth is still 35% growth, whether we
    measure 100% of the cases or 50%.
    <P>If, for example, Italy is detecting 50% of the cases and the
    US is detecting 25% of cases, this affects any predictions of how
    far the US is behind Italy At 35% growth, cases double every 2.5
    days, so this undersampling would show the US 2.5 days further
    behind than it really is.
    <P>Likely no-one except Korea and Singapore are getting close to
    100% of cases.  Probably everyone is detecting at least 20% of
    cases, because those require medical attention.  We don't really
    know what fraction of cases are missed, but the difference in
    sampling between countries might skew the delays by a few days in
      either direction.

  <P><B>Q: Comparing with Italy as a whole is flawed. Shouldn't you be comparing with Lombardy?</B>
    <P>Perhaps.  Certainly cases in Italy are concentrated in the
    North at the moment.  Lombardy is running about seven days ahead
    of the rest of the country, as measured by cases per million
    inhabitants. I've shown this in <a href="#g3">graph 3</a>. The
    problem is that cases in some other countries, notably France,
    Spain and the USA, are also concentrated, so comparing these
    entire countries with Lombardy is biased in the other direction.
    These graphs give a crude indication, but they're never going to
    be able to track problems down to the local level, where an
    individual town is overwhelmed by cases before this becomes
    commonplace in a country.  Just remember, to compare with
    Lombardy, a rough approximation is to move the Italy curve seven days
    to the right.
    <P><B>Q: Shouldn't you break out China by province?</B>
    <P> At the moment I'm only showing China on the graphs that show
    absolute counts, not counts per million inhabitants.  As the vast
    majority of Chinese cases were in Hubei, there's not a great deal
    of difference on these graphs between showing Hubei and showing
    all of China.  The population of Hubei province is around 57
    million, which is roughly the same as Italy.  Thus the data for
    China is reasonably comparable with the data for Italy.
<P>
   The Chinese data is somewhat suspect in the early days, so it's not
   very good for comparison until the epidemic gets a fair way along.
   Mostly I'm using Italy to provide a model for how other places
   might progress, as it's a better fit.  But as of March 16th, I've
   changed the last (linear) graph to use the Chinese data to show one
   possible direction that Italy might follow.
<P>
   Elsewhere in China, cases that arose were stamped on quickly, and
   pretty much all of China shut down until that was complete.  In
   Europe we failed to learn from that model, so we're all much
   further along than Beijing, Shanghai, or similar provinces ever
   got.
      
  <P><B>Q: Why didn't you show my country?</B>
    <P>A1. Until the number of cases reaches around 100, the data
    tends to be too noisy to draw conclusions
    <P>A2. The graphs are pretty cluttered as it is.  
    <P>A3. I'll add more as I find time.

  <P><B>Q: You aren't an epidemiologist. Why should I listen to you?</B>
    <P>You probably shouldn't.  I'm a computer scientist and I've
    spend decades analysing data, but you should talk to a real
    epidemiologist if you want to understand the underlying causes.
    Computer scientists do know a lot about exponential growth though.
  <P><B>Q: I'm a journalist.  Will you appear on my TV show?</B>
    <P>No. You should have a real epidemiologist on your TV show.
