This page presents historical SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection
information.  I try to present it in a way that helps inform about how
the virus is progressing throughout the main outbreaks worldwide in a
way that allows countries to be compared and perhaps lessons learned.
The underlying infection and containment processes are complicated,
and conclusions you or I may draw from these graphs are not true
predictions.  For that, you'd need much more data about what is being
done in each country, and about how the data is collected. Comments
are my interpretation only.  Nevertheless, I hope you find it useful.

  establish a new trend.
  <LI>For nearly two weeks the UK has been on the 22% daily increase

  <LI> Normalizing by population makes little difference for most of the countries shown.

    last week.
  <LI> See the <a href="#end">this death rates graph</a> for why I am
    not confident in this placement for Switzerland - it appears that
    Switzerland is testing more widely than Italy, so Switzerland is
    likely to be perhaps as much as 10 days behind Italy.
  <LI>Spain stayed at 35% daily increases for much longer than any
    other large European country, which caused it to close on Italy,
    then followed the 22% curve for a week. Althouh Spain has now
    moved to a lower daily increase rate, it has not followed Italy
    and France down to 13%.

<img src="26mar2020/deaths-eu-norm.png">
  <LI><I>Commentary updated: 2020-03-24</I>
    <LI> The graph shows number of <B>deaths per million
      inhabitants</B>, plotted on a log scale, against time.  The
      country curves are shown offset by the amounts shown.
    <LI> As different countries have different testing policies, many
      people have suggested that we should look at deaths instead.
      There are several downsides to using deaths as a metric.  First,
      if the purpose of these graphs is to provide warning of what is
      to come, or to verify whether measure are working, deaths is not
      very useful.  Death rate is too low to provide a warning signal
      in advance of there being a problem, and it is not a good early
      indicator of whether measures are working because it lags case
      data by between one and two weeks.  It can, however, provide
      some insight into what fraction of infections are being detected
      in different countries.  Generally, if a country is further
      behind in this graph than in the equivalent cases graph, then
      the country is probably catching a larger fraction of cases.
      This is particularly pronounced in the case of Germany.
    <LI>
      Death data is also problematic because deaths per day does not
      go down quickly when cases go down.  This is particularly clear
      in the Korean data, where the death rate has remained nearly
      constant for three weeks after new infections peaked.
    <LI>
      Finally, when a healthcare system gets overwhelmed, death rate
      goes up from something like 0.9% (Korea) to something like 3-4%
      (Hubei, parts of Lombardy).
    <LI>
      Generally when cases are increasing exponentially, most
      countries' death rate curves shadow the cases curve, with a lag
      of between 6 (France, UK) and 12 days (Germany).  Spain, France,
      Netherlands and the UK look very similar to how the looked using
      case data around 6 days ago.  Germany is about ten days further
      back on this graph.  The difference in
      per-capita testing rates does not seem to explain this
      difference.

  <LI> The graph shows number of <B>confirmed cases per million inhabitants</B>, plotted on a   log scale, against time.  The country curves are shown offset by the amounts shown.  

  <LI>I have aligned the 35% daily increase rate parts of the four
    graphs, so the points at which they diverge can be seen.  As a
    result the graph shows Lombardy as being 5.5 days ahead of Italy,
    but a more realistic value based on today's data points is seven
    days ahead.

  <LI>Lombardy now appears to have peaked, though I won't be sure of
  this for a few more days.  See Graph 3.  The daily increase in cases
  is today was roughly the same as ten days ago, with a peak five days
  ago.

  <LI>Switzerland tracked along the 35% curve about six days further
    than Italy did, so comparing with Italy as a whole no longer seems
    to be the right baseline. The Lombardy results provide a better
    new reference curve.  Beware though that these time estimates
    depend on both Lombardy and Switzerland detecting roughly the same
    fraction of cases.  Switzerland is only testing severe cases at
    this point, and Lombardy was clearly overloaded at the same point.
    The death rate in Lombardy at this
    point was, however, about four times higher than in Switzerland.
    It is risky to read too much into the death rates, but it might
    mean that Switzerland is counting a larger fraction of infected
    people than Lombardy did at the same point; if so, then
    Switzerland is further behind Lombardy than I have suggested.  THe
    death rate curves in the previous graph certainly suggest this may
    be the case.

  <LI>Austria has been on the 35% daily increase curve, but the last
  five days' increases have been lower. Austria now appears to be
  following the Lombardy curve about ten days behind.

     inhabitants</B>, plotted on a log scale, against time.  The country
	curves are shown offset by the amounts shown.
      <LI>Data for most Nordic countries shows large waves of
      imported cases, with increase rates above 35%, followed by a
      slump as the imports cease. Sometimes this is followed six or so
	days later by an echo of the original surge.
      <LI>Iceland suffered a large number of imported cases relative
      to its very small population.  After that burst stopped, Iceland
      followed roughly the same curve as Italy, two days ahead.  Eight
      days ago Iceland's increase rate increased for five days, but it
      has now levelled off at a similar rate to Italy. It is possible
      that this is due to increased testing rather than a burst in new cases.
      <LI>I will discuss Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland on the
      next graph.  Unfortunately the data no longer looks similar to the South
      Korean curve.

	curves are shown offset by the amounts shown, and the <B>case counts are reduced by the amounts shown.</B>
      <LI> These countries experienced a large wave of imported cases.
      However, it appears they were effective at contact tracing for
      these cases, and most of them were effectively quarantined.
      Despite this, it appears a non-negligible number of local
      infections escaped detection, and from this smaller base,
      exponential growth continued.  I have subtracted the amounts
      shown from the case counts before plotting - these represent my
      guess at the number of imported cases and their immediate
      contacts that were stopped by contact tracing.  If we subtract
      these values, the remaining cases show straight lines at the
      characteristic values of 35% or 22%.  Am I convinced by these
      offset ammounts?  No, not completely - see Norway below.  But this way of viewing
      the data makes more sense to me than the raw counts in the previous
	graphs.
      <LI>Sweden appeared to be growing exponentially at 35% per day
	from a base of about 220 active cases six days ago, but a
	sudden change to a 16% daily increase rate occurred five days
	ago.
      <LI>Finland appears to have been growing exponentially at 22%
      per day from a base of about 135 active cases nine days ago.  The last three days hint that a change to a lower increase rate similar to Sweden's 16% has occured.
      <LI>Denmark was growing exponentially for seven days at 22% per
	day from a base of about 185 active cases nine days ago.  The last four days Sweden seems to have moved to a lower increase rate similar to Sweden.
	<LI>Norway appeared to be growing exponentially at 35% per day
	from a base of about 260 active cases six days ago. Norway
	also appears to have switched to a 16% daily increase the last
	few days.

      <LI>In Belgium, the inital early ramp-up appears to be mostly

      <LI>Ireland and Portugal continue to follow the Italian curve closely, about 12 days behind.
      <LI>Luxembourg has a very small population, so the curve is

      well above the point Lombardy reached at this stage of the

<LI>Luxembourg is such an outlier in the previous graph that this
leads me to doubt that the confirmed case data is comparable with
other countries.  The number of deaths in Luxembourg is very small -
only eight - but it's just enough that we can get a very rough
cross-calibration of case data vs death data.  It seems likely that
testing in Luxembourg is much more effective than in France or Italy,
and so is identifying many more people whose symptoms would be too
mild to merit testing in France or Germany.  It is clear that there
are a large number of cases in Luxembourg, but not so many more per
million inhabitants as the previous graph shows.  It looks like deaths
lag case data by about ten days more in Luxembourg than in France.
The German data shows a similar additional lag.

     this was due to limitations in testing.
     <LI>Japan is an enigma.  The testing rate there is low, so cases
     may be being underreported.  However consistently missing the
     same fraction of cases would not affect the exponential growth
     doubling time, which had been extremely consistent at 8.5% per
     day for many weeks, until the last week when it has declined
     further.  It seems more likely that early measures taken there
     are being effective at reducing the increase rate, but are not
     sufficient to avoid exponential growth altogether. It looks like
     the combination of early school closure, plus ubiquitous face
     masks and regular Japanese good hygene may be responsible for
     Japan's unique track. No-one really knows,

  <LI>In this view, the US moves a few days further behind Italy.  This
  is probably deceptive, and it might be better to show data for
  New York State, for example, on this graph.
  <LI>I've added a curve for Singapore, which contained the initial
  imported cases very well.  The graph shows a worrying slow but
  steady super-exponential growth recently though, perhaps indicating
  that current measures are starting to not be effective, or that more
  cases are being imported again.  I've been told that most of the new
  cases are imports; it makes sense that if Singapore's quarantining
  of visitors and contact tracing is mostly keeping on top of local
  spread, then as the pandemic ranges worldwide, Singapore will see an
  equivalent rise in imported cases.  The number of untraced cases remains small at this time.

  <LI> The graph shows number of confirmed cases per million
  inhabitants, plotted on a log scale, against time.  Each US state
  curve is shown offset by the amount shown in the key so as to align the curves.
  <LI>Most US states are a long way behind European countries, but
  several now have comparable rates per million inhabitants, and New York is ahead. I have
  plotted the states with most confirmed cases.
  <LI>European countries moved from a 35% daily increase curve to a
  22% daily increase curve; Washington is one of the few US states to
  have clearly made a similar transition, and in the last few days the
  daily increase rate has declined further.  Washington is the only US
  state with a large number of cases to start to turn the tide
  significantly..
  <LI>New York was growing at close to the 35% daily increase rate
  seen in Europe, but then had large increases over four days.  This
  usually happens when cases have been spreading undetected, and
  suddenly testing starts catching up.  I have placed New York based
  on the last week of roughly 35% growth, but today's datapoint would
  place New York several days growth above Italy.  At Italy seems to
  have peaked and New York has more cases per head of population than
  Italy, it makes no sense saying where New York is on Italy's track:
  New York is forming its own track.
  <LI>New Jersey, Louisiana, Illinois, Michigan, Colorado and Florida
  have been increasing recently at close to the 35% daily increase
  rate seen in Europe, so I've placed then on that curve, though this
  gives misleading time delays relative to Italy.  Based on the most
  recent data point, New Jersey is 12 days behind Italy.
  <LI>California shows a slightly lower increase rate, recently close
  to the 22% per day curve, and the data is very clean.

<LI>The graph shows <B>deaths per million inhabitants</B>, plotted on a log scale, against time.  The country curves are shown offset by\
 the amounts shown. 
<LI>Confirmed cases in the US have been growing very fast recently.
The US testing procedures were very slow to get started, but are
reported to have scaled up quickly.  How much of the rapid increase in
case data is due to this scale-up?  This graph shows the US death
rate, with Italy and France for comparison.  When looking at confirmed
cases, the US is roughly 15 days behind Italy, whereas when looking at
death rates, the US is roughly 19 days behind Italy.  This probably
indicates that a small part of the recent increases is indeed due to
improved testing, but the difference is nowhere near as large as
Germany or Luxembourg, so the underlying infection rate must also be
high.  If this gap widens in the future, then this would be evidence
  that testing is getting ahead of the epidemic.
  <LI> To put this in perspective if Italy is identifying just the ~10% of infections that need ICU care, the US is probably identifying very roughly ~30% of infections. (1.35 ^ 4 ~= 3)

  <LI>Very few warm countries have enough cases to establish a clear
  increase rate trend.  The graph shows number of confirmed case for
  some typical "cool" countries and some "warm" ones.  During the
  timescale shown, Spain had experienced cool weather.
  <LI>Malaysia, India, Bahrain, Kuwait and Egypt are all warm countries and have all been experiencing
    roughly 14% daily growth.
  <LI>Australia used to be on the 14% curve, but ten days ago it
  switched to the 22% curve.  The results from ten days ago correspond
  to infections from roughly 17-20 days ago.  The mean daytime
  temperature in Sydney for the five days before March 3rd (17 days
  ago) was 28.6C, whereas for the five days after March 3rd it was
  23.8C.  More analysis is needed to know if this is significant.
  <LI>Malaysia had a large increase four days ago, but since seems to be tracking close to 14%.
  <LI>Brazil seems to be tracking roughly along the 35% line, which seems to run counter to warm weather inhibiting the spread of the virus.
  <LI> Both Qatar and Bahrain have very low recent increase
  levels. This may indicate that most cases were imports, and that
  local spread has been effectivel contained.
  <LI>Although Singapore has a warm climate, I have ommited it from
  this graph, because strong contact tracing there dwarfs any
    climate-dependent effect we might observe.
  <LI> In general, it does appear that COVID19 may spread more slowly in warm climates, but the evidence is inconclusive, with Brazil being the main counterexample.

  <LI><I>Commentary updated: 2020-03-26</I>
  <LI> The graph shows number of confirmed cases, plotted on a linear
    scale, against time.  The country curves are shown offset by the
    amounts shown.  In the other graphs I use a log scale on the y-axis because
    exponential growth gives a straight line on a log-linear graph, and this makes changes in the growth rates visible and allows exponential growth rates to be compared. However, many
    readers have told me they don't like log-linear graphs, so this one is for them.  It
    has to be truncated, or you cannot see any information.  It
    doesn't really show anything additional over the log graphs,
    except it looks scarier and shows how much worse things are set to get if effective measures are not taken.
    <LI>I have shown the China curve until the daily increase rate
    drops below 0.1%.  The glitch in the center of this curve is a
    change in measurement methodology.  If Italy followed a similar
    curve, this wave of the epidemic may have abated in 30 days time,
    but this prediction should be tempered by the fact that Italy has
    not quite reached the logistics curve inflection point, though it
    appears to be close.  On this basis, because deaths lag infections
      by 1-2 weeks, the worst is yet to come for many Italian hospitals.
   <LI>One thing this view shows well is how much of an outlier the US
   is - the faster increase rate of the US
   curve is self-evident.  The US exceeded both China and Italy's
   case counts today.
<LI>This view also makes clearer the recent restart of exponential
  growth in Iran.  It is unclear to me whether exponential growth
  actually had previously stopped in Iran, or whether the increase
  rate was simply limited by their testing capacity.  If it was the
  latter, then something about their process for confirming cases has
  changed.

<P><B>Q: Can I have your data?</B>
  <P>My data is <a href="https://github.com/mhandley/COVID19/">on github</a>..
  <P>A more complete dataset is the <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series">Johns Hopkins</a> one. It tends to lag the national data sources and the WHO, but it is complete and machine readable.

  <P><B>Q: Can I use your graphs?</B>
  <P>
    Yes, they're under a CC0 "No rights reserved" license.  You can
    use them for any purpose.  I'd prefer you link back here though,
    as the explanations add important context.

  <P><B>Q: Different countries are testing at different rates.  How can you compare the data?</B>
    <P>So long as the fraction of actual cases being detected does
    not change, this does not affect any inference we can make about
    the growth rate.  35% growth is still 35% growth, whether we
    measure 100% of the cases or 50%.
    <P>If, for example, Italy is detecting 50% of the cases and the
    US is detecting 25% of cases, this affects any predictions of how
    far the US is behind Italy At 35% growth, cases double every 2.5
    days, so this undersampling would show the US 2.5 days further
    behind than it really is.
    <P>Likely no-one except Korea and Singapore are getting close to
    100% of cases.  Probably everyone is detecting at least 20% of
    cases, because those require medical attention.  We don't really
    know what fraction of cases are missed, but the difference in
    sampling between countries might skew the delays by a few days in
      either direction.

  <P><B>Q: Comparing with Italy as a whole is flawed. Shouldn't you be comparing with Lombardy?</B>
    <P>Perhaps.  Certainly cases in Italy are concentrated in the
    North at the moment.  Lombardy is running about seven days ahead
    of the rest of the country, as measured by cases per million
    inhabitants. I've shown this in <a href="#g3">graph 3</a>. The
    problem is that cases in some other countries, notably France,
    Spain and the USA, are also concentrated, so comparing these
    entire countries with Lombardy is biased in the other direction.
    These graphs give a crude indication, but they're never going to
    be able to track problems down to the local level, where an
    individual town is overwhelmed by cases before this becomes
    commonplace in a country.  Just remember, to compare with
    Lombardy, a rough approximation is to move the Italy curve seven days
    to the right.
    <P><B>Q: Shouldn't you break out China by province?</B>
    <P> At the moment I'm only showing China on the graphs that show
    absolute counts, not counts per million inhabitants.  As the vast
    majority of Chinese cases were in Hubei, there's not a great deal
    of difference on these graphs between showing Hubei and showing
    all of China.  The population of Hubei provice is around 57
    million, which is roughly the same as Italy.  Thus the data for
    China is reasonably comparable with the data for Italy.
<P>
   The Chinese data is somewhat suspect in the early days, so it's not
   very good for comparison until the epidemic gets a fair way along.
   Mostly I'm using Italy to provide a model for how other places
   might progress, as it's a better fit.  But as of March 16th, I've
   changed the last (linear) graph to use the Chinese data to show one
   possible direction that Italy might folliow.
<P>
   Elsewhere in China, cases that arose were stamped on quickly, and
   pretty much all of China shut down until that was complete.  In
   Europe we failed to learn from that model, so we're all much
   further along than Beijing, Shanghai, or similar provinces ever
   got.
      
  <P><B>Q: Why didn't you show my country?</B>
    <P>A1. Until the number of cases reaches around 100, the data
    tends to be too noisy to draw conclusions
    <P>A2. The graphs are pretty cluttered as it is.  
    <P>A3. I'll add more as I find time.

  <P><B>Q: You aren't an epidemiologist. Why should I listen to you?</B>
    <P>You probably shouldn't.  I'm a computer scientist and I've
    spend decades analysing data, but you should talk to a real
    epidemiologist if you want to understand the underlying causes.
    Computer scientists do know a lot about exponential growth though.
  <P><B>Q: I'm a journalist.  Will you appear on my TV show?</B>
    <P>No. You should have a real epidemiologist on your TV show.
